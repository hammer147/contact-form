# Contact Form

This project is boilerplate for a contact form that uses:

- react-hook-form
- zod
- resend
- sonner
- server-actions

Note that server-actions are in alpha and should not be used in production yet.  
Also, you would want to add a captcha to the form, or expose it only to logged in users.
